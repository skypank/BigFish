#BigFish version 0.0.1
Project bigfish is started in order to filter stocks for investing and trading without any emotional bias.

This reads stocks from the list of available stocks and do analysis both fundamental and technical to provide
the conclusion whether the stock should be invested for long term or traded for short term or rejected.

The name BigFish is synonymous to the idea of fish in pond as stocks in stock market.
The algorithm roughly works on similar principle (as of now)
 1. Fish enters the pond
 2. Fish is passed through segregation based on 
    2a. Management quality
    2b. Business quality
    2c. Valuation
 3. Once decided the decision module takes it forward and decide whether to trade or invest 
 4. Targets and stop loss are determined based on initial thesis of stock
 5. Once achieved, stock is re-rated for re-trading or re-investing.
 6. Profit and loss list is maintained.
 7. a list of dirty fish are maintained to avoid any trap.

 The detailed alogrithm and design daigrams will be uploaded soon.
